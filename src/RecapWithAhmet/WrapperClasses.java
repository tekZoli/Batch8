    //POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTION:
    //1) what is wrapper class?
    //2)How many types of wrapper classes do you know?
    //3)Can you explain what they are with a SIMPLE example?

    //1) it is a process of CONVERTING the OBJECT to PRIMITIVE
    //or PRIMITIVE TO OBJECT
    //2)There is two types of it.
    //3) Autoboxing: it converts PRIMITIVE data to OBJECT
    // int a = 5; INTEGER i = new INTEGER(a)
    //*) UNBOXING : it converts OBJECT data to PRIMITIVE
    // INTEGER a = (int) 5; // **CAST***
