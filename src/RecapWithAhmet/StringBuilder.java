        //POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTION:


        //1) WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRING BUILDER AND STRINGBUFFER
        //2)WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRING AND STRING BUILDER?


        //1) They are similar but the main different is synchrinazition which means in my
        //mind is first come first serve. Before it moves on the next action, it completes
        //the first one. (one by one) --> **WAIT TIME**** --> STRING BUFFER AND HASHTABLE
        //ARE BOTH SYNCHRONIZED
        //*String buffer execution is slower than String builder because of this wait time.

        //2) STRING AND STRING BUILDER :
        //* STRING IS IMMUTABLE
        //*STRING BUILDER IS MUTABLE
        //*STRING AND STRING BUILDER HAVE SOME DIFFERENT METHODS(APPEND, REVERSE..)

//        public static void main(String[] args) {
//            String name= new String("ahmet");
//            String name1= "mehmet";
//            Set<String> list = new HashSet<>();
//        }
