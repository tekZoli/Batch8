    //can you tell me about map and why do you use it?
    //balance is key and customer is the value????????/is the way of storing data as a key and value format


    //what is the connection between map and collections?
    //map has key/value, and key only stores the unique value and it is acting as a set
    //value may or may not store duplicates as a value which means is acting like list



    //what types of map you know and differences
    //Hashmap--randomly stores
    //LinkedHashMap --insertion order
    //TreeMap--ascending order

    //HashMap!!!!!!!
    // is Thread Safe(NOT SYCHRONIZED)
    //it means the system will wait i]until the action is done then it will continue
